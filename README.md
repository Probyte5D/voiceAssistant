# Voice Assistant - Weather, News, and Commands

This is a voice-controlled assistant built in Python that allows you to interact with weather, news, and various other functionalities using speech commands. The assistant utilizes several libraries such as `pyttsx3`, `speech_recognition`, `requests`, `googletrans`, and `tkinter` for a simple graphical user interface (GUI).

### Features:
- **Weather Updates**: Get the current weather of any city by simply asking the assistant.
- **News Headlines**: Get the latest news headlines from TechCrunch, translated into Italian.
- **Voice Interaction**: Speak to the assistant to ask about the time, weather, and more.
- **Custom Commands**: The assistant can perform various tasks such as greeting the user, providing the current time, and more.
  
### Technologies Used:
- **Python**: The main programming language used for the assistant.
- **pyttsx3**: A Python library for text-to-speech conversion, enabling the assistant to speak responses.
- **SpeechRecognition**: Used for speech-to-text conversion, allowing the assistant to understand spoken commands.
- **requests**: Used to make API requests to get real-time data like weather and news.
- **googletrans**: A library to translate news articles into Italian.
- **Tkinter**: A built-in library for creating the GUI for the assistant.

### Setup Instructions:

1. **Clone or Download the Repository**:
   - Clone the repository using: 
     ```
     git clone https://github.com/yourusername/voice-assistant.git
     ```
   - Or, simply download the ZIP file from the repository and extract it.

2. **Install Dependencies**:
   - Install the required Python libraries using `pip`. Open your terminal and run the following commands:
     ```
     pip install pyttsx3
     pip install requests
     pip install speechrecognition
     pip install googletrans==4.0.0-rc1
     pip install python-dotenv
     pip install pyaudio
     ```

3. **Set up API Keys**:
   - This assistant requires two API keys:
     - **Weather API** (from [OpenWeatherMap](https://openweathermap.org/api)).
     - **News API** (from [NewsAPI](https://newsapi.org/)).
   - Create a `.env` file in the project root directory with the following contents:
     ```
     API_KEY=your_weather_api_key
     API_KEY_NEWS=your_news_api_key
     ```

4. **Running the Assistant**:
   - Once all dependencies are installed and API keys are set up, run the assistant:
     ```
     python main.py
     ```

5. **Interacting with the Assistant**:
   - After launching the program, you will see a simple GUI with a button labeled "ðŸŽ¤ Listen".
   - Click the button or use the microphone to speak commands such as:
     - "Whatâ€™s the weather in [city]?"
     - "What time is it?"
     - "Give me the latest news."
   - The assistant will respond to your commands with both speech and text.

### Example Commands:
- "Whatâ€™s the weather in Rome?"
- "Give me the latest news."
- "What time is it?"
- "How are you?"
- "Say hello!"

### Notes:
- Ensure that your microphone is properly configured and accessible for the `speech_recognition` library to work correctly.
- The assistant uses `pyttsx3` for speech output. If you experience issues with speech quality or language, check your systemâ€™s installed voices and adjust settings in the code as necessary.
